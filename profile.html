										<h2>Personal projects</h2>
										<h3>1. GROCERY DELIVERY WEBSITE using full stack (FARMO FRESH):</h3>
										<p>Farm O Fresh is a full-stack project designed to support small-scale local grocery businesses by providing a platform to sell their products online. This initiative allows local stores to reach nearby customers more effectively, increasing their business opportunities. The platform enables store staff to deliver products themselves, ensuring timely and efficient service. Customers benefit from accessing a wider variety of products at fair prices, enhancing their shopping experience. This project not only boosts local businesses but also fosters community connections and convenience.</p>
										<h3>2. IMAGE SEARCH ENGINE Using full stack :</h3>
										<p>An imagesearch engine using a full stack architecture involved developing a web application where users can upload an image to search for similar images or related content. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular for a responsive and interactive user interface. The backend, powered by Node.js or Django, handles user requests and processes image data. The application uses a database, such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, to store metadata and search indices, and integrates machine learning algorithms for image recognition and similarity matching. The entire system is deployed on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, ensuring scalability and efficient performance.</p>
										<h3>3. Dice Game:</h3>
										<p>Developed this simple and customized dice game in java • User needs to pick three random number between 1-6 and then roll the dice for 3 times • User will win if the sum of dice rolls is smaller than the sum of numbers user choose AND difference between the sum is less than 3</p>
